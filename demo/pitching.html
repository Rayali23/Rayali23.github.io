    <p class="texttype1"> Pitching tips</p>
    <p class="texttype1"> Stance: Keep your eyes on the plate, pivot your foot 90 degrees, and lift your stride leg with your thigh and shin at a 90 degree angle. 
</p>
     <p class="texttype1"> Arm action: When your stride foot hits the ground, cock your throwing arm behind your head with your elbow leading. Your forearm should be almost parallel to the ground, and the ball should be behind your ear. 
</p>
    <p class="texttype1">Leg drive: Use your lower body to transfer energy from the ground up. Push off the rubber with your back leg and drive your front hip toward the plate. 
Follow-through: Continue your arm's path after releasing the ball. End low, with your chest over your front knee at the release. </p>
      <p class="texttype1"> Body alignment: Maintain proper alignment throughout the pitching motion to generate power and minimize arm stress.

Learn from the game: Pay attention to the game, and try to learn from what you see.
