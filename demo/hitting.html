    <p class="texttype1"> Hitting Tips</p>
<p class="texttype1"> Stance:
Keep your weight evenly distributed between your feet, with your knees slightly bent.Your front shoulder should be lower than your back shoulder, and your hands should be close to your back shoulder, above your back foot. 
</p>
<p class="texttype1"> Swing:
Make sure your front foot is down before you swing, and your hands follow a straight path to the ball. Your load should be slow and controlled, similar to cocking a hammer on a revolver. 
</p>
    <p class="texttype1"> Follow through:
Make sure you have a good, balanced follow through. 
Timing: Maintain a rhythmic movement in your stance to help with timing. You can also practice a soft focus on the pitcher, then move to a hard focus as they release the ball.</p>
      <p class="texttype1"> Practice:
Practice hitting to all areas of the field to become a more effective hitter. 
</p>  
   <p class="texttype1"> Relax
Keep your hands relaxed and loose until you swing, as tight muscles are slower and less responsive. 
</p>
     <p class="texttype1">Think slow
To swing faster, think loosey-goosy. To master a movement, perform it slowly, then let loose when it's time to swing.
